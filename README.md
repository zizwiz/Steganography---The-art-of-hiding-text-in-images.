# Steganography---The-art-of-hiding-text-in-images.
This project demonstrates how to hide soem text in plain sight inside an image. Steganography is often used to hide copyright information in an image, movie, or audio file. If you pirate the file, then the owner can prove you did so by decoding it and pulling out their copyright information.

I made a small study into how this works and had read a few articles and seen some code samples. Here I am joining some of those sample ideas to form apps. I also include a document that is the write up of my learning which I share with others.
